Processes and signals
This is a brief overview of processes and signals in Unix-based systems.

Processes
A process is an instance of a program that is currently being executed. Each process is assigned a unique identifier called a PID (process identifier). Processes can interact with the operating system, other processes, and external resources such as files, network connections, and hardware devices.

Processes can be managed and controlled using various commands and tools provided by the operating system. Some common operations that can be performed on processes include:

Starting a new process
Terminating an existing process
Suspending and resuming a process
Changing the priority of a process
Monitoring the resource usage of a process
Signals
A signal is a software interrupt that is sent to a process to notify it of an event or to request it to perform a particular action. Signals can be sent by the operating system, other processes, or the process itself.

Some common signals and their meanings are:

SIGINT (2): Interrupt from keyboard
SIGKILL (9): Kill signal
SIGTERM (15): Termination signal
SIGSTOP (17): Stop process
SIGCONT (19): Continue process
Signals can be sent to a process using the kill command or the kill() system call. Processes can handle signals by setting up signal handlers using the signal() function or the sigaction() system call.

Conclusion
Processes and signals are fundamental concepts in Unix-based systems. Understanding how processes work and how to manage them is essential for developing and deploying applications on these systems. Similarly, knowing how to handle signals can help you write robust and reliable software that can respond to different types of events and errors.
